# Logistics-Optimization-for-Delivery-Routes-Amazon
🚚 Logistics Optimization for Delivery Routes – Amazon

This project focuses on optimizing Amazon’s delivery network using SQL-based data analysis.
I explored multiple datasets (Orders, Routes, Warehouses, Delivery Agents, and Shipment Tracking) to identify performance bottlenecks and suggest improvements.

🔑 Key Highlights

✅ Cleaned and prepared raw datasets (duplicates, missing values, invalid dates).

✅ Analyzed delivery delays across routes, warehouses, and agents.

✅ Built KPIs such as On-Time Delivery %, Average Delay per Region, and Traffic Delay per Route.

✅ Compared top vs bottom performers (agents, warehouses) for actionable insights.

✅ Recommended strategies to improve efficiency and reduce delays.

🛠️ Tech Stack

SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL) – data cleaning, joins, CTEs, window functions.

Data Visualization – mandatory charts (delayed routes, warehouses, agent performance, delay reasons, regional delays).

Data Analytics Concepts – KPI building, performance ranking, bottleneck identification.

📊 Insights

A few specific routes caused the majority of delivery delays.

Certain warehouses acted as bottlenecks due to high processing times.

Top-performing agents consistently outperformed slower agents by a big margin.

Traffic and process issues were the most common causes of shipment delays.
